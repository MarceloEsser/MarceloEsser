### Hi! 
My name is Marcelo, I am twenty two years old and I am from Brazil, Canoas-RS. I am a mobile software engineer since since I was eighteen.
<br>In that time I've worked with React Native, Ionic, Flutter, iOS (swift) and Android (Java and Kotlin), being the ones I chose to pursue my career: Flutter and Android.
<br>Since childhood I have been passionate about mathematics and astronomy.
<br>I am currently doing a BA in Computer Science and studying English (intermediate).
<br>In my leisure time I like to read more (science fiction more specifically) and sometimes I play a little video game too.
<br>The rest you can find out by contacting me or exploring my available repositories! ðŸ¥³
